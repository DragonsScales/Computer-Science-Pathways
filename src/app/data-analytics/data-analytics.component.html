  <h1>Data Analytics</h1>
  <p>
    Data analytics is the process of examining data sets to draw conclusions about the information they contain.
    It involves using various techniques and tools to analyze data, identify patterns, and extract valuable insights that can inform decision-making.
    <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/data-analytics">There are four key types of data analytics: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive.</a>
    Descriptive analytics focuses on analyzing <a href="https://www.jaspersoft.com/articles/what-is-descriptive-analytics">historical data to identify patterns and relationships.</a>
    Diagnostic analytics goes beyond descriptive analytics by examining data to understand the reasons behind past outcomes.
