  <p>
    Software Developer is a really vague term, and when someone says, "I'm a Software Developer,"
    that explains just as much as saying you work in IT.
    For our purposes, Software Developer means someone who works designing, building, and testing software.
    <br />
    <br />
    There are further classifications of Software Developer, such as: Front-end Developer, Back-end Developer, and Full-stack Developer.
    These are the main types we will be focusing on.
  </p>
  <h2>Front-End Developer</h2>
  <p>
    Front-end developers build the visual aspects of an app or website.
    This is the text you read, the buttons used to navigate, and other interactive elements, such as animation.
    The languages commonly used for front-end development for the web fall in the realm of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
    These three are considered the backbone of the web. <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ml-html5">HTML is used by 96.8% of all websites.</a> of all websites and JavaScript/CSS extend its functionality.
    <br />
    <br />
    HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and gives the structure of a webpage.
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and extends the functionality of HTML by allowing for styling.
    JavaScript is a programming language that allows for dynamic content on a webpage.
  </p>
  <h2>Back-End Developer</h2>
  <p>
    Imagine a popular game, when started it needs to load. What's going on? Why does it need to load?
    It's initializing the systems it needs and, if it's online, it's connecting to the server.
    This part is considered the back-end and is the part that the user doesn't see.
    The back-end handles logic and data management. Most programming languages can be used as a back-end with a few
    of the most popular being JavaScript (NodeJS), Java, C#, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Go.
  </p>
  <h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>
  <p>
    Full-stack developers are a combination of front-end and back-end developers.
    They combine the skills of Front-end and Back-end developers to create the entire application.
    Where a front-end developer may only know how to build the visuals and interface, and a back-end developer only the logic/data management,
    a full-stack developer can do both.
    Indeed has a great article on <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/full-stack-developer-definition">Full-Stack Developers</a> that elaborates further.
